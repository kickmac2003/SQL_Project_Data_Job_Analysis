# Background
Motivated to apply my newly acquired SQL skills, I undertook this project to analyze the 2023 Data Analyst job market using job postings. The goal is to provide job seekers and other stakeholders in data analytics with insights into the most in-demand and top-paying skills, what I term 'optimal skills.' This analysis aims to guide individuals in prioritizing skill investments for securing high-value opportunities.

The data for this project was sourced from Luke Barousse's [SQL Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql). 

### The following research questions guided my SQL queries:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these high-paying roles?
3. Which skills are most frequently required by employers for data analyst positions?
4. What are the skills associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most valuable skills to acquire for optimal career prospects?

# Tool Used
To conduct an in-depth analysis of the data analyst job market, I leveraged a combination of powerful tools:

- **SQL**: Served as the foundation of my analysis, enabling me to extract valuable insights from the database.

- **PostgreSQL**: Provided a robust database management system, perfectly suited for handling and analyzing job posting data.

- **Visual Studio Code**: Served as my primary interface for database management and executing SQL queries.

- **Git & GitHub**: Facilitated version control, collaboration, and project tracking by enabling me to share and manage my SQL scripts and analysis.

# The Analysis
To gain insights into the data analyst job market, I developed a series of targeted queries. Here's how I approached each research question:

### 1. Top-Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To pinpoint the most lucrative data analyst roles, I filtered job postings by average annual salary and location, with a specific focus on New York, USA. This query reveals the highest-paying opportunities in the field, providing valuable information for job seekers and industry professionals alike.
```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg,
    company_dim.name AS company_name,
    job_schedule_type,
    job_location,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location LIKE '%New York%' AND
    salary_year_avg 
    IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10;
```
